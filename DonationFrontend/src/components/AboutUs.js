              <p>
                In India, we often see NGOs and donors working in silos lacking
                a common standardized platform to handle end-to-end donation
                processes. Spread the Smile-Donation Platform aims to address
                this critical issue by bridging this gap between donors and
                recipients. In this system, donors will be assisted throughout
                the donation decision-making process. Verified recipientsâ€™
                demands will be fulfilled swiftly through volunteers. This
                platform promises to bring credibility and efficiency in the
                existing system.

                    The idea is to create self-sustained chapters across the

                    process, inspire people around us to give back to those who
                    need it most.

                    zero-funds organization that works to get surplus food,
                    stationary, clothes from society and the community to serve
                    them to the less fortunate people.
